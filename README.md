In this project, I am assuming myself as the Data Analyst for a Supermarket, I performed Data Analyis in Python by using some libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), then Data Cleaning, Univariate Analysis, (EDA) Exploratory Data Analysis, after that created Charts and Plots to Visualize Data, Or Created an interactive Dashboard using PowerBI.

Key requirements of analysis are: Is there any relationship between customer ratings or significantly related to any variable.

Lastly at the end of project, I prepared Analysis Report or Dashboard of my Data Analysis with an executive summary for the various stakeholders.
